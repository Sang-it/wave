# Wave
An over-engineered multi paradigm (toy) language that comes with its whole ecosystem.
The language will have many implementations; I just want to learn how everything works.

Planned Language Implementations:
- Interpreter
- ByteCode-Interpreter(VM)
- LLVM

Planned components:
- Linter
- Formatter
- Minifier
- LSP (maybe)
